==How to compile and install==

The procedure is tested on a Debian Linux 7.0 i686 32bit architecture, it is reported to work also on 32bit armhf architecure.
Packages usually required but not installed by default are:
binutils, gcc, libc6-dev, libgomp1, linux-libc-dev, make, python-dev, and zlib1g-dev, these are mostly development libraries needed to compile OpenCaster.
You can install/upgrade/verify the packages typing as root on a Debian with the following command:

apt-get install --no-install-recommends binutils gcc libc6-dev libgomp1 linux-libc-dev make python-dev zlib1g-dev python-dateutil

To build the package you need to type 

make 

into OpenCaster directory.
To install the tools in the system you need to type 

make install 

with root privileges.
